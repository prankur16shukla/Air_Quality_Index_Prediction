In this Regression project we extracted the data related to Air Quality Index from a Website. We have pre-processed the extracted data and made predictions on the AQI based on other factors. We have solved this problem by different algorithms along with Hyper Parameter Tuning.

Algorithms used :
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression
6. XG Boost Regression
7. K Nearest Neighbors Regression
8. Artificial Neural Network

Later we compared the performances of these models based on mean absolute error, mean squared error and root mean squared error.
